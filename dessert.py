"""
Complete the class Dessert:

create instance variables for name and calories
create an instance method healthy which returns a bool. A dessert
instance with fewer than 200 calories would be considered healthy
create an instance method delicious which returns a bool. All dessert
instances should return True

Create the class JellyBean:

JellyBean should be a child of the Dessert class
JellyBean should take three arugments - name, calories, flavor
Keep your init method DRY with super()
JellyBeanâ€™s delicious method should return the default set in the parent
class, unless its flavor is black licorice, which is not delicious

I learn that everytime you want to go back to the ihneret class you use
the super(), like in the definition of delicious on the JellyBean class.
